# Credit Card Approvals
A project building interpretable and robust supervised classification models for credit card approval, based on various sociodemographic attributes. This project was a culmination of
efforts to understand and build more transparent models in sectors that handle important data, such as the finance sector.

The project was built for Cornell Tech's Advanced Machine Learning together with Maya Powell and Joo Kim.
